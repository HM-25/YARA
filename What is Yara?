Yara: The Pattern Matching Swiss Knife
Introduction

Yara is a powerful tool for identifying information based on binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings within a file.
Yara Rules

Yara rules are used to label patterns and determine if a file is malicious based on its features. Strings, a fundamental component of programming languages, store data such as text in applications.

Example: Printing "Hello World" in Python

python

print("Hello World!")

A Yara rule can be written to search for "Hello World" in every program on an operating system.
Malware and Strings

Malware, like other applications, uses strings to store textual data. Examples of data stored within strings by various malware types include:
Type	Data	Description
Ransomware	12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw	Bitcoin Wallet for ransom payments
Botnet	12.34.56.7	The IP address of the Command and Control (C&C) server
Caveat: Malware Analysis

Explaining malware functionality is a vast topic. For more detailed information on strings, see "Task 12 - Strings" in the MAL: Introductory room. A whole Learning Path is being created for this. For a fundamental understanding, check out the introductory room.
